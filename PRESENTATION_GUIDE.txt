## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING (If Something Goes Wrong)

### Problem: Port 8000 already in use
**Solution:**
```cmd
netstat -ano | findstr :8000
taskkill /PID [PID_NUMBER] /F
python server.py
```

### Problem: Port 9999 already in use
**Solution:**
```cmd
netstat -ano | findstr :9999
taskkill /PID [PID_NUMBER] /F
python honeypot.py
```

### Problem: Model not found
**Solution:**
```cmd
python train_model.py
```

### Problem: Browser shows "can't be reached"
**Solution:**
- Check Terminal 1 is running
- Try: http://localhost:8000
- Try: http://127.0.0.1:8000

## 🎬 PRESENTATION SCRIPT

### Opening (30 seconds)
"Today I'm presenting an AI-powered honeypot system that detects malicious network traffic in real-time using machine learning."

### Demo Start (30 seconds)
"Let me show you how it works. First, I'll start the backend server..."
[Run: python server.py]

"Now the honeypot listener..."
[Run: python honeypot.py]

"And here's the web dashboard..."
[Open: http://127.0.0.1:8000]

### Live Demo (2 minutes)
"When I click Start Honeypot, it begins monitoring for connections..."
[Click Start Honeypot]

"You can see connections coming in, and our ML model classifies them as benign or malicious..."
[Point to logs]

"Now let me simulate an actual attack..."
[Run: python simulate_attack.py]

"Watch the honeypot terminal - it detected the connection and classified it!"
[Show Terminal 2]

### Technical Explanation (2 minutes)
"The system has three main components:
1. Socket honeypot on port 9999 - captures connections
2. ML detector - Random Forest classifier analyzing traffic patterns
3. Web dashboard - real-time monitoring and CSV logging

All data is saved to connections.csv for later analysis."

### Closing (30 seconds)
"This system can be deployed in production to detect and log malicious activity, helping security teams identify attack patterns and protect networks."
